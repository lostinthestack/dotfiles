This will be a testing repository for :
* Learning GitHub
* Storing my dotfiles off-site
* Optimizing my dotfiles
* ...and apparently learning markdown

# Eye Candy

Something to look at before you delve into the files :
![bar]
* **Status bar**
  * This is the bar at the top of the screen.  bar.sh is piped into LemonBar.
  * Goals here are to : 
    * optimize the script with a more appropriate update loop
    * create a parsing system to streamline styling for color, orientation, etc.
    * remove silly spaghetti code and refine my knowledge of bash and scripting in general
#

![screen]
* **Just look at it!**
  * Things working behind the scenes here include the utilization of some pretty nifty applications (that are obviously not mine).
  * The list includes :
    * Pywal - For setting terminal colors, as well as the colors used by lemonbar and relevant scripts
    * Neofetch
    * Cmatrix
    * Terminator (simply the best $TERM and only correct choice)
    * MacChanger
    * ...and the list goes on
